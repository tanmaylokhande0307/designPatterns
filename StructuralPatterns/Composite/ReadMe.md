### Intent
Compose objects into tree like structures to represent part whole hierarchies.
Composite pattern lets the client treat an indivisual objects and  composition of objects uniformly.

#### Applicability
Use the Composite pattern when
• you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
• you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of
objects and individual objects. Clients will treat all objects in the composite
structure uniformly.
