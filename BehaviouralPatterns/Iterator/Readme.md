### Intent
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without
exposing its underlying representation.

Use the Iterator pattern
• to access an aggregate object's contents without exposing its internal repre-
sentation.
• to support multiple traversals of aggregate objects.
• to provide a uniform interface for traversing different aggregate structures
(that is, to support polymorphic iteration).
