Creational class patterns defer some part of the object creation to subclasses, while creational object pattern defers it to another object

The structural class patterns use inheritance to compose classes, while structural object pattern describe ways to assemble objects

The behavioural class patterns use inheritence to describe algorithms and flow of control, whereas the behavioural object patterns describe how a group of objects cooperate to perform a task that no single object can carry out alone

### Principles of Object Oriented Design
Program to an interface not to an implementation
Favour object composition over inheritance


### composition
strong has-a relationship
the part cannot exist without the whole
Represented by filled diamond on the association line


### Aggregation
weak has-a relationship
the part can exist on its own
Represented by empty diamond on the assiciation line

### Inheritance 
is-a relationship
